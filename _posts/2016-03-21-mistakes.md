I have made a series of mistakes already in the few months that I have been doing the gardening.  The first was trying to plant onions from seeds in the propagator.  I have to say that the terminology used in gardening is not always particularly clear and at times it feels like a bit of  a law to follow rather than a series of guidelines.  When gardeners say transplant your seedlings when they get their first proper leaves  there is an assumption that all seedlings will have leaves in the first place.  I left my onions in the propagator for months in the hope that they developed more than the single stem that was emerging from the seed.  What ended up happening was really spindly not very attractive looking bits of grass, in the end I managed to transplant one into a plant pot and even that looks remarkably poor!
